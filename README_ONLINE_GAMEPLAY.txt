WHAT DIFFERENT GAME MODIFIERS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVER? HOW TO PLAY VS MY FRIEND? HOW TO MAKE "X" ROOM? 

To change those, put this value in PSW (Password) field when connecting to a server.

For Single no password needed.
For Match, M
For Tag, T
For TCG only cards, TO#
For OCG only cards, OO#
For a LP change, LPxxxxxx#     (XXXX = the number)
For time limit change, TMXXX#   (XXX = the number. Limit is 999)
For starting hand change, STXX#  (XX = the number, no greater then 60)

For draw change (card you draw per turn), DRXX   (XX = the number, no greater then 35)

For banlist change, LFX#     (X = a number less then 9. TCG = 1, OCG = 2, World = 3)

For no banlist, NF#
For no check deck, NC#
For no shuffle, NS#
For Master Rule 3, PR#
To apply multiple rules, you must split the setting with a , with a # at the end.
For example, if I want tag with 20000 LP, OCG banlist, it would be
LF2,LP20000,T#

For named room add your desired room name after #
For private room that won't show on roomlist, add $yourPassword

Maximum room password is 20 characters! Otherwise it will default to single random duel!

To play against your friend, simply put the same PSW into the field as them and click "Join", or find them on the roomlist. You will be placed in the same room.
